You can test your own unconscious biases with [Harvard's Implicit Association Test](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/education.html \"Project Implicit\").[Goldin & Rouse](https://www.nber.org/papers/w5903 \"Orchestrating impartiality\") found blind auditions in orchestras increased the likelihood that a woman is selected by 30% to 60% - how about blind applicant finding and filtering?\r\n\r\nIn addition, studies have shown that we have biases based in names. [Moss-Racusin et al.](http://www.pnas.org/content/109/41/16474.abstract?ijkey=2729d4cd2121eb87cc3eb5791a6926d53f9fa766&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha \"Science facultyâ€™s subtle gender biases favor male students\") found, in a double-blind study of the the same application with typically male and female names, like James and Jane, that assessors rated James as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) Jane. The assessors also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to James. And it didn't matter whether the assessor was a man or a woman - we are all affected by unconscious bias. Equally, [Bertrand and Mullainathan](https://www.nber.org/papers/w9873 \"Are Emily and Greg More Employable than Lakisha and Jamal? A Field Experiment on Labor Market Discrimination\") found significant discrimination against African-American sounding names: White sounding names received 50 percent more callbacks for interviews. And this affected the benefits of a better resume too - a higher quality resume elicits 30 percent more callbacks for a Whie-sounding name, whereas for African American sounding names, it elicits a far smaller increase.\r\n\r\nRecruiters use LinkedIn to find, shortlist and contact candidates. As LinkedIn displays both names and profile photos, recruiters are susceptible to this bias. It may affect whether or not they choose to shortlist or contact a candidate, and their overall perception of a candidate's ability, outside of the relevant facts about that candidate.\r\n\r\nFaceless LinkedIn removes names and photos in both standard and recruiter account searches and profile views to help reduce the effects of unconscious bias.\r\n\r\n## How does it work?\r\n\r\nOnce you've activated the Chrome Extension, Faceless LinkedIn will automatically replace names and profile pictures from profiles, searches, recruiter searches and recruiter projects.\r\n\r\nThe blue Faceless LinkedIn icon will appear to the right in your address bar (by the favourites star icon). Clicking this icon gives a popup with a button to manage your Chrome Extensions (so you can enable/disable Faceless LinkedIn) and a link to find out more. \r\n\r\n## Can I try it out?\r\n\r\nYes. The extension is not currently in the Chrome App Store (so you try it at your own risk!), but if you download these files, then open chrome://extensions/ in the Google Chrome browser and tick 'Developer mode', you can 'Load an unpacked extension'. Select the Faceless LinkedIn folder and click 'Select'. Faceless LinkedIn should now be working, and a blue Faceless LinkedIn icon should appear to the right, inside your address bar. You can disable it at any time by going back to chrome://extensions/ \"Chrome Extensions Manager\" and unchecking the 'Enabled' box.\r\n\r\n## Can I contribute?\r\n\r\nYes please! I'll happily consider pull requests. As the project develops I'll set up some issues and contributor docs. ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
